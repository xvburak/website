    <Faq title="Is Gitpod secure?">
      <p>
        Gitpod is secure by design and at the heart of what we do. Your source
        code is safely stored in the cloud, never locally. Each Gitpod workspace
        and prebuild runs on a secured single-use container providing fast
        startup times without compromising on security. Learn more at <a
          href="/security">gitpod.io/security</a
        >. We are also in the process of receiving the SOC2 compliance report.

    <Faq title="How does Gitpod differ from GitHub Codespaces?">
      <p>
        With Gitpod you can get started in a flash, the startup times are
        significantly faster than with GitHub Codespaces. Gitpod is also a lot
        more resource efficient and thereby very cost-effective. With Gitpod you
        can choose the tools you would like to work with. It's open source and
        also available for self-hosting. Learn more on <a
